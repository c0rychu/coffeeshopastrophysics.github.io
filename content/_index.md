Coffeeshop Astrophysics is a series of informal public lectures aimed at anyone interested in getting a taste of modern science, all from the comfort of your local coffee shop. Members of the Leonard E Parker Center for Gravitation, Cosmology and Astrophysics will guide you through the interesting, unusual, and sometimes bizarre concepts that guide the modern understanding of our universe. At the end of each lecture, we hope to have rekindled or ignited a passion for astrophysics!

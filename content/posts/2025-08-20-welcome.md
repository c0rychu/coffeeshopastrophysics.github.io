These are a series of informal public lectures aimed at anyone interested in getting a taste of modern science from the comfort of your local coffee shop. Members of the Leonard E Parker Center for Gravitation, Cosmology and Astrophysics will guide you through the interesting, unusual, and sometimes bizarre concepts that guide the modern understanding of our universe. At the end of each lecture, we hope to have ignited or rekindled a passion for astrophysics!

Most lectures will begin at **1 pm on the Saturdays** specified in the schedule.
